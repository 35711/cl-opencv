cl-opencv
=========

This is a project that aims to provide Common Lisp bindings to a
reasonable subset of the OpenCV library (see
http://opencv.willowgarage.com for details). The initial focus will be
on image capture and transforms, though later this may be expanded to
deal with the machine learning and other aspects of OpenCV. I will
attempt to test at least SBCL and CLISP, but cannot really guarantee
anything beyond SBCL, as this is the Lisp I use in my projects.

This project was forked from ryepup's cl-opencv
(https://github.com/ryepup/cl-opencv) as that project seems to have
stagnated fairly quickly after its inception.
