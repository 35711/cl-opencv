cl-opencv
=========

These are OpenCV bindings for SBCL. They do not promise to be
complete.  Current code has been tested with sbcl 1.0.45 and OpenCV
2.2.0 from MacPorts on Mac OS X 10.6. Current code is also known to
work on Ubuntu 10.10 (64-bit) with OpenCV 2.1 and SBCL 1.0.40 from the
Ubuntu repositories. In the future I hope to expand testing to CLISP
on these platforms. If you have had success running cl-opencv on some
other platform, please let me know.
