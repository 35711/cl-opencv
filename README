cl-opencv
=========

These are OpenCV bindings for SBCL. They do not promise to be
complete.  Current code has been tested with sbcl 1.0.45 and OpenCV
2.2.0 from MacPorts on Mac OS X 10.6. In the future I hope to test on
some common Linux distribution and possibly using clisp.

Installation on Ubuntu
======================
> sudo aptitude install libhighgui-dev

Troubleshooting
===============

If you CFFI problems loading the library, be sure:
 * your lisp and your OpenCV library are both 32 bit or both 64 bit
 * if you installed OpenCV to a non-standard location, you might try
 adding that path to cffi:*foreign-library-directories*

Different camera support different resolutions and framerates.  The
tests assume a camera capable of about 30fps at 640x480.  Adjust the
values at the top of test.lisp to match your camera.  A program like
VLC can help you determine those.
